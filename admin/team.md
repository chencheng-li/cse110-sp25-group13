## Team brand

# Values:
- Accountability: Take responsibility as a member of the team and any parts of the project you are working on. 
- No judgement: Limit judgement on other members of the group not related to the project itself, as we want the group to be a safe space to share ideas and not worry about whether or not an idea will come across as "dumb".
