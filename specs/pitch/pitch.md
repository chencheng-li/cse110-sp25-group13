# Group 13 Pitch Document

### Statement of purpose:
UCSD College Card Compare is a web app designed to bring the spirit of campus life into a simple, collectible-card format. Our mission centers on three key goals:
1. **Nurture friendly rivalry**: Transform college pride into playful competition by letting students “duel” cards representing UCSD’s colleges, dining spots, monuments, and lecture halls. This lighthearted rivalry fosters community engagement and encourages students to learn more about each campus entity.
2. **Capture Campus Nostalgia**: In the wake of beloved themed worlds like Club Penguin closing down, we aim to recreate that same nostalgic charm: an offline, themed game that’s instantly accessible and fun to play.
3. **Educate and Inform**: Provide a visually engaging way for prospective and current students to discover the unique features and fun facts about each UCSD college and campus landmarks, helping them in their college decision-making and exploring campus.

### User personas:

### MVP Features:
- College Card View (Read):
  - Display a predefined, static set of "Cards" (Monument, dining, mascot, lecture hall),  each with card fun description that informs you about an aspect of UCSD at the bottom.
  - Data for these cards is stored locally (IndexedDB).
  - Example:
    - Monuments: Sun God, Geisel, Warren Bear
    - Dinings: 6th, 64, bistro
    - Lecture Halls: Revelle Galbraith, 6th, Warren
    - Mascot: Triton King
    - When 2 cards of the same type are played, use internal rank to break tie, eg: each dining hall has a rank compared to other dining halls: Bistro> Foodworx
